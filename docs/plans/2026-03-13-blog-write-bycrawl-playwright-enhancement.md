# Blog-Write ByCrawl + Playwright Enhancement Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Enhance `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` with bycrawl MCP social intelligence and Playwright-based SERP/Trends scraping to produce higher-ranking, data-enriched blog articles.

**Architecture:** The existing 7-phase workflow stays intact. We inject bycrawl + Playwright into existing phases as optional enrichment steps (user can opt out). New sub-phases (1.3, 2.5) are added as validation gates. A new reference file `references/social-serp-research.md` holds the detailed API call patterns so the SKILL.md stays under 500 lines.

**Tech Stack:** ByCrawl MCP (`mcp__bycrawl__*`), Playwright (via Bash), existing WebSearch/WebFetch tools.

---

## Task 1: Create the Social & SERP Research Reference File

This new reference file holds all bycrawl API call patterns and Playwright scraping scripts so the main SKILL.md can reference them without bloating.

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/blog/references/social-serp-research.md`

**Step 1: Write the reference file**

```markdown
# Social & SERP Research Guide

Reference for bycrawl MCP and Playwright-based research in blog-write workflow.

## ByCrawl MCP Tool Patterns

### Social Keyword Discovery (Phase 1.3 + Phase 2)

Search across platforms for the target keyword to find long-tail variations,
emerging synonyms, and question-format keywords.

#### Calls (~8 per topic):
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{keyword}", sort="new", count=30)`
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{keyword}", sort="top", count=30)`
- `x_search_posts(query="{keyword}", product="Latest", count=30)`
- `x_search_posts(query="{keyword}", product="Top", count=30)`
- `tiktok_search_videos(keyword="{keyword}", count=30)`
- `youtube_search_videos(q="{keyword}", count=15)`
- `threads_search_posts(query="{keyword}", search_type="top", count=20)`

#### Extract:
- **Emerging terms**: Keywords in "Latest/new" but not in "Top" = newly trending
- **Long-tail variations**: From Reddit titles and YouTube video titles
- **Question-format keywords**: High search intent signals
- **Volume signal**: If <10 results across 3+ platforms, topic may be too niche

### Content Gap Analysis (Phase 2)

Pull top-performing social content to identify saturated vs. underserved angles.

#### Calls (~8 per topic):
- `youtube_search_videos(q="{topic}", count=15)`
- `tiktok_search_videos(keyword="{topic}", count=20)`
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{topic}", sort="top", count=20)`
- `x_search_posts(query="{topic}", product="Top", count=20)`

#### For top 3-5 YouTube videos, pull transcripts:
- `youtube_get_video_transcription(videoId="{id}", language="en")`

#### Extract:
- What everyone already covers (saturated — differentiate or skip)
- Content gaps: audience demand but no good content
- Unique angles competitors miss

### Comment Mining for FAQs (Phase 2 + Phase 5l)

Pull comments from top content to extract real audience questions.

#### Calls (~6-10):
- `youtube_get_video_comments(videoId="{id}", count=50)` (top 3 videos)
- `tiktok_get_video_comments(videoId="{id}")` (top 3 videos)

#### Extract:
- Recurring questions → FAQ items
- Pain points → H2 section topics
- Exact phrases → natural language for article body

### Audience Language Mining (Phase 5)

Extract hooks, pain points, and desire language from top social content.

#### Calls (~10):
- `tiktok_get_video_subtitles(videoId="{id}", language="en")` (top 3)
- `youtube_get_video_transcription(videoId="{id}", language="en")` (top 3)
- Comment pulls from above

#### Emotional trigger searches:
- `x_search_posts(query="{topic} love OR hate OR wish OR need OR finally", product="Top", count=20)`
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{topic} frustrated OR amazing OR changed my life", sort="top", count=20)`

#### Apply to writing:
- **Intro**: Use proven hook patterns from top-performing social content
- **Body**: Weave in audience pain point phrases (their actual words)
- **Examples**: Reference real social discussions ("As one Reddit user noted...")
- **Tone**: Match what resonates on social (formal vs. casual by engagement data)

### Competitor Social Audit (Phase 2)

Check competitor content on social and audience reactions.

#### Calls (~6-9):
- `x_search_posts(query="{competitor} {topic}", product="Top", count=20)`
- `youtube_search_videos(q="{competitor} {topic}", count=10)`
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{competitor} {topic}", sort="top", count=15)`

#### Extract:
- What competitors say about this topic on social
- Audience sentiment (positive, skeptical, bored)
- Gaps in competitor messaging our article can fill

### Post-Write Keyword Validation (Phase 6)

After drafting, verify keyword is still actively discussed.

#### Calls (~4):
- `reddit_search_posts(query="{keyword}", sort="new", count=20)`
- `x_search_posts(query="{keyword}", product="Latest", count=20)`
- `tiktok_search_videos(keyword="{keyword}", count=15)`
- `threads_search_posts(query="{keyword}", search_type="latest", count=15)`

#### Interpret:
- High recent volume = keyword is alive, proceed
- Low volume with declining trend = consider pivoting or noting freshness risk

---

## Playwright SERP & Trends Scraping

### Google Trends Data (Phase 2)

Scrape interest-over-time, related queries, and rising breakout terms.

#### Script:
```bash
npx playwright-cli exec --browser chromium -- node -e "
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q={keyword}&date=today+12-m');
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000);
  // Extract interest over time data
  const data = await page.evaluate(() => {
    const points = document.querySelectorAll('.line-chart text');
    return Array.from(points).map(p => p.textContent);
  });
  // Extract related queries
  const related = await page.evaluate(() => {
    const items = document.querySelectorAll('.related-queries-content .label-text');
    return Array.from(items).map(i => i.textContent);
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ interest: data, related }));
  await browser.close();
})();
"
```

**Fallback**: If Playwright is unavailable, use `WebFetch` on Google Trends embed URLs
or fall through to WebSearch: `[keyword] google trends 2026 interest`.

### SERP Feature Analysis (Phase 2.5)

Scrape Google search results to identify SERP features and competitor content.

#### Script:
```bash
npx playwright-cli exec --browser chromium -- node -e "
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com/search?q={keyword}');
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
  const results = await page.evaluate(() => {
    // Extract People Also Ask
    const paa = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-q]'))
      .map(el => el.getAttribute('data-q'));
    // Extract organic titles
    const titles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h3'))
      .map(h => h.textContent).slice(0, 10);
    // Extract related searches
    const related = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.k8XOCe'))
      .map(el => el.textContent);
    // Detect SERP features
    const features = {
      hasAIOverview: !!document.querySelector('[data-attrid=\"ai_overview\"]'),
      hasFeaturedSnippet: !!document.querySelector('.hgKElc'),
      hasPAA: paa.length > 0,
      hasKnowledgePanel: !!document.querySelector('.kp-wholepage'),
    };
    return { paa, titles, related, features };
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(results));
  await browser.close();
})();
"
```

**Fallback**: Use `WebSearch` for `"{keyword}" people also ask` and manually
inspect result snippets.

### People Also Ask Extraction (Phase 3)

PAA questions from SERP scraping feed directly into:
- H2 heading candidates (use as question-format headings)
- FAQ section items (high-intent questions Google already surfaces)

### Competitor Title Pattern Analysis (Phase 5a)

From the SERP scrape titles, analyze:
- Number usage frequency (e.g., "7 Ways...", "2026 Guide")
- Question vs. statement ratio
- Power word presence ("Ultimate", "Complete", "Essential")
- Year inclusion
- Average character length

Use these patterns to craft a title that fits the winning pattern but stands out.

## Social Proof Embedding Patterns

When writing (Phase 5), embed real social quotes as evidence:

```markdown
<!-- [SOCIAL DATA] -->
> As one Reddit user in r/webdev noted: "We switched to server components
> and saw a 40% reduction in bundle size" — a sentiment echoed across
> multiple threads with 2,000+ combined upvotes.
```

Attribution format:
- Reddit: "A discussion in r/{subreddit} with {upvotes} upvotes..."
- X/Twitter: "As @{handle} noted in a post with {likes} likes..."
- YouTube: "In a video with {views} views, {channel} demonstrated..."

---

## Task 2: Update SKILL.md Frontmatter — Add ByCrawl Tools

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md:1-22`

**Step 1: Update the frontmatter**

Replace the existing frontmatter with:

```yaml
---
name: blog-write
description: >
  Write new blog articles from scratch optimized for Google rankings and AI
  citations. Generates full articles with template selection, answer-first
  formatting, TL;DR box, information gain markers, citation capsules, sourced
  statistics, social intelligence from bycrawl MCP, SERP analysis via Playwright,
  Pixabay/Unsplash images, built-in SVG chart generation, FAQ schema,
  internal linking zones, and proper heading hierarchy. Supports MDX, markdown,
  and HTML output.

  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - WebFetch
  - WebSearch
  - Task
  - mcp__bycrawl__*
---
```

**Step 2: Update key references block**

Add the new reference to the key references list after line 35:

```markdown
- `references/social-serp-research.md` — ByCrawl API patterns and Playwright SERP scraping
```

**Step 3: Verify**

Run: `head -25 skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: `mcp__bycrawl__*` in allowed-tools list

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add bycrawl MCP tools to blog-write allowed-tools and references"
```

---

## Task 3: Add Phase 1.3 — Social Demand Validation Gate

Insert a new phase between Phase 1 (Topic Understanding) and Phase 1.5 (Template Selection).

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (insert after Phase 1, before Phase 1.5)

**Step 1: Insert Phase 1.3 after the Phase 1 block (after line 45)**

```markdown
### Phase 1.3: Social Demand Validation (Optional)

> "Would you like me to validate this topic with live social signals from bycrawl? (yes/no)"

If yes, run quick social volume check across platforms (see `references/social-serp-research.md`
§ Social Keyword Discovery):

1. **Cross-platform search** — Query Reddit, X, TikTok, YouTube, Threads for the keyword
2. **Signal assessment**:
   - **Strong** (50+ results across 3+ platforms): Proceed with confidence
   - **Moderate** (20-50 results): Proceed but note niche audience
   - **Weak** (<20 results total): Warn user — consider pivoting or niching down
3. **Extract early intelligence**:
   - Long-tail keyword variations from social titles
   - Question-format keywords (high intent)
   - Emerging terms in "Latest" but not "Top" (newly trending)
4. **Feed into Phase 1.5** — Social signals help select the right template
   (e.g., high question volume → `faq-knowledge`, viral debate → `thought-leadership`)

If no, skip to Phase 1.5.
```

**Step 2: Verify insertion**

Run: `grep -n "Phase 1.3" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Line showing "Phase 1.3: Social Demand Validation"

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 1.3 social demand validation gate to blog-write"
```

---

## Task 4: Enhance Phase 2 — ByCrawl Social Research

Add bycrawl enrichment steps to the existing Phase 2 (Research).

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (Phase 2 section, after existing step 4)

**Step 1: Add bycrawl research steps after the existing step 4 (line ~100)**

Insert after `- Map data points to chart formats`:

```markdown

#### ByCrawl Social Research (Optional)

> "Would you like me to enrich research with live social data from bycrawl? (~20-30 API calls)"

If yes, run these enrichments (details in `references/social-serp-research.md`):

5. **Content gap analysis** — Search top-performing content across Reddit, X,
   TikTok, YouTube to identify what's saturated vs. underserved
6. **Comment mining** — Pull comments from top 3 YouTube and TikTok videos to
   extract real audience questions → feed into FAQ and H2 topics
7. **Real social statistics** — Use engagement data from viral posts as original
   data points (e.g., "A Reddit thread with 4.2K upvotes revealed...")
8. **Competitor social audit** — Check what competitors publish about this topic,
   how audiences react, and what gaps exist in their messaging
9. **Audience language** — Extract hooks, pain points, and desire language from
   transcripts and comments for use in Phase 5 writing

Record social findings in a `## Social Intelligence` section of research notes.
```

**Step 2: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "ByCrawl Social Research" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Line showing the new section header

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add bycrawl social research enrichment to Phase 2"
```

---

## Task 5: Add Phase 2.5 — SERP Intelligence via Playwright

Insert a new phase between Phase 2 (Research) and Phase 3 (Outline Generation).

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (insert after Phase 2, before Phase 3)

**Step 1: Insert Phase 2.5 after Phase 2 block**

```markdown
### Phase 2.5: SERP Intelligence (Optional)

> "Would you like me to scrape Google for SERP features and competitor analysis? Uses Playwright."

If yes, run Playwright SERP scraping (scripts in `references/social-serp-research.md`):

1. **Google Trends data** — Scrape interest-over-time for the keyword (past 12 months)
   and related/rising queries. Feed trend data into chart generation (Phase 4).
2. **SERP feature detection** — Identify: AI Overview, Featured Snippet, PAA box,
   Knowledge Panel. Adapt content format to target available features.
3. **People Also Ask extraction** — Pull PAA questions to:
   - Use as H2 heading candidates (Phase 3)
   - Add to FAQ section (Phase 5l)
4. **Competitor title analysis** — Analyze top 10 organic titles for patterns:
   number usage, question format, year inclusion, power words, character length.
   Feed into title crafting (Phase 5a).
5. **Related searches** — Extract "Related searches" and "People also search for"
   for secondary keyword coverage.

**Fallback**: If Playwright is unavailable, use `WebSearch` for PAA and competitor
title data. Google Trends can be approximated via `WebSearch` queries.

Feed SERP intelligence into:
- Phase 3 outline (PAA → H2 headings, related searches → subtopics)
- Phase 4 charts (Google Trends data → trend line chart)
- Phase 5a title (competitor title patterns)
- Phase 5l FAQ (PAA questions)
```

**Step 2: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "Phase 2.5" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Line showing "Phase 2.5: SERP Intelligence"

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 2.5 SERP intelligence via Playwright"

---

## Task 6: Enhance Phase 5 — Social Proof & Audience Language

Add social data integration to the content writing phase.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (Phase 5 section)

**Step 1: Add new section 5d-bis for Social Data markers (after existing 5d, line ~250)**

Insert after the Information Gain Markers section (5d), updating the marker list:

```markdown
- `[SOCIAL DATA]` — Insights derived from social platform analysis via bycrawl.
  Real engagement metrics, audience sentiment patterns, cross-platform trends
  not available in traditional research
```

**Step 2: Add new section 5n — Social Proof Embedding (after 5m, before Phase 6)**

```markdown
#### 5n. Social Proof Embedding (if bycrawl data available)

When bycrawl research was run in Phase 2, embed real social evidence:

**Reddit quotes:**
```markdown
<!-- [SOCIAL DATA] -->
> A discussion in r/{subreddit} with {upvotes} upvotes highlighted a common
> frustration: "{exact quote}" — a pattern repeated across multiple threads.
```

**X/Twitter references:**
```markdown
According to @{handle}, whose post received {likes} likes: "{quote}."
```

**YouTube/TikTok data:**
```markdown
In a video with {views} views, {channel} demonstrated that {finding} —
confirmed by {N} comments echoing similar results.
```

Rules:
- Attribute with platform, engagement metric, and context
- Use social data to reinforce (not replace) tier 1-3 research sources
- Target 2-3 social proof embeddings per article
- Each embedding earns `[SOCIAL DATA]` information gain credit
```

**Step 3: Verify both insertions**

Run: `grep -n "SOCIAL DATA\|5n\. Social Proof" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Lines showing both additions

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add social data markers and social proof embedding to Phase 5"
```

---

## Task 7: Enhance Phase 6 — Social Validation Gate + SERP Checks

Add new quality check items to Phase 6.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (Phase 6 section)

**Step 1: Add social/SERP validation items after the existing check 18 (end of burstiness section)**

```markdown

#### Social & SERP Validation (if enrichment was used)
19. **Social content gap addressed** — Article covers at least 1 content gap identified from bycrawl social data
20. **Audience language incorporated** — At least 3 pain point phrases or desire language from social comments woven into body copy
21. **Social proof present** — At least 2 `[SOCIAL DATA]` markers with real engagement metrics
22. **PAA coverage** — If PAA was extracted, at least 2 PAA questions addressed in H2s or FAQ
23. **Keyword still active** — Run post-write keyword validation via bycrawl (see `references/social-serp-research.md` § Post-Write Keyword Validation). If social volume dropped significantly since Phase 1.3, flag for user review.
24. **Google Trends alignment** — If Trends data was scraped, verify article doesn't focus on a declining interest curve
```

**Step 2: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "Social & SERP Validation" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Line showing the new subsection

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add social & SERP validation checks to Phase 6 quality gate"
```

---

## Task 8: Enhance Phase 7 — Social Metrics in Delivery Summary

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md` (Phase 7 delivery template)

**Step 1: Add social intelligence section to the delivery summary template (after Dual-Optimization Elements block)**

```markdown
### Social Intelligence (if bycrawl enrichment was used)
- Platforms queried: [list — Reddit, X, TikTok, YouTube, Threads]
- Content gaps identified: [N] ([brief descriptions])
- Audience phrases incorporated: [N]
- Social proof embeddings: [N] with [SOCIAL DATA] markers
- FAQ items sourced from comments: [N] of [total FAQ items]
- Keyword social volume: [strong/moderate/weak]

- PAA questions extracted: [N] (used in: [H2s / FAQ / both])
- Google Trends direction: [rising / stable / declining]
- Competitor titles analyzed: [N]
```

**Step 2: Also add new Next Steps items**

Add after existing next steps:

```markdown
- If bycrawl was used: verify social quotes are still current
- If Trends data was used: schedule re-check in 3 months for freshness update
```

**Step 3: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "Social Intelligence\|SERP Intelligence" skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Lines showing both new delivery sections

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog-write/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add social & SERP metrics to Phase 7 delivery summary"
```

## Task 9: Update Quality Scoring Reference (Optional)

Add `[SOCIAL DATA]` as a recognized information gain marker in the scoring rubric.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md:11`

**Step 1: Update the Originality row**

Change:
```
| Originality/unique value markers | 5 | Original data, case studies, first-hand experience |
```

To:
```
| Originality/unique value markers | 5 | Original data, case studies, first-hand experience, social platform intelligence |
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md
git commit -m "feat: add social platform intelligence to quality scoring originality criteria"
```

---

## Task 10: Final Line Count Verification

**Files:**
- Verify: `skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Check line count**

Run: `wc -l skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: Under 550 lines (stretch target — detailed reference file absorbs most content)

If over 550, move verbose sections to `references/social-serp-research.md` and
replace with one-line pointers.

**Step 2: Check all references resolve**

Run: `grep 'references/' skills/blog-write/SKILL.md`
Expected: All referenced files exist

**Step 3: Final commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: verify blog-write SKILL.md line count and reference integrity"
```
