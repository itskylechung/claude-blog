## Features

### ByCrawl Social Intelligence Integration

[ByCrawl MCP](https://bycrawl.com) enriches blog production with live cross-platform social data (~42-52 API calls per article). Social signals correlate **3x more with AI visibility than backlinks**.

#### Why ByCrawl + claude-blog?

Without ByCrawl, the blog skill relies on `WebSearch` — you get Google results but miss the demand signals, audience language, content gaps, and social proof that live on social platforms. ByCrawl turns the skill from a search-optimized writer into a **social-intelligence-powered content engine**.

| Without ByCrawl | With ByCrawl |
|----------------|-------------|
| Topics chosen by gut instinct or keyword tools | Topics validated by real cross-platform demand (Reddit, X, TikTok, YouTube, Threads) |
| Generic AI-sounding copy | Copy infused with real audience language — hooks, pain points, and phrasing mined from transcripts and comments |
| FAQ sections based on guesses | FAQ items sourced from actual YouTube/TikTok comments people are asking right now |
| No competitive social context | Competitor messaging gaps identified — what they say, how audiences react, what they miss |
| Publish and hope | Post-write freshness check confirms the keyword still has active social volume |
| Standard sourced statistics | Social proof with real engagement metrics: `"A Reddit thread with 4.2K upvotes revealed..."` |
| Content that ranks | Content that ranks **and** gets cited by AI systems — social signals are the #1 predictor of AI visibility |

#### ByCrawl Across All Skills

ByCrawl is integrated into **11 of 13 sub-skills** — the entire content lifecycle, not just writing:

| Skill | What ByCrawl Adds | API Calls |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| `/blog write` | Topic validation, content gaps, comment mining, audience language, social proof, post-write validation | ~42-52 |
| `/blog rewrite` | Content gap analysis, audience language for rewrites, social proof embedding | ~15-20 |
| `/blog brief` | Social demand validation, audience pain points, FAQ sourcing from comments | ~20-23 |
| `/blog outline` | Question-format H2 candidates from social, content gaps | ~8-12 |
| `/blog strategy` | Competitor social audit, audience demand mapping, language mining | ~20-30 |
| `/blog calendar` | Trending topic detection, social volume for scheduling priority | ~10-15 |
| `/blog analyze` | Social visibility check, brand presence assessment | ~4-6 |
| `/blog audit` | Per-post social demand validation (Strong/Moderate/Weak) | ~2-3/post |
| `/blog repurpose` | Platform-specific intelligence (Reddit, X, YouTube, LinkedIn) | ~8-12 |
| `/blog geo` | Social brand signals for AI citation audits | ~4-6 |

Skills without ByCrawl (structural — no social data needed): `blog-chart`, `blog-schema`, `blog-seo-check`, `blog-humanize`

#### How ByCrawl Enriches Each Phase

| Phase | What ByCrawl Adds | API Calls |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Topic Validation** | Cross-platform demand check across Reddit, X, TikTok, YouTube, Threads — catches low-demand topics before you write | ~8 |
| **Content Gap Analysis** | Finds what's saturated vs. underserved across platforms, mines competitor blind spots | ~8 |
| **Comment Mining** | Extracts real audience questions from YouTube/TikTok comments → FAQ items and H2 topics | ~6-10 |
| **Audience Language** | Pulls hooks, pain points, and desire language from transcripts and emotional-trigger posts | ~10 |
| **Competitor Social Audit** | Checks competitor messaging, audience sentiment, and positioning gaps | ~6-9 |
| **Post-Write Validation** | Confirms keyword still has active social volume before you publish | ~4 |

**Platforms covered**: Reddit, X/Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Threads, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Dcard

**How it works in `/blog write`**:
```
Phase 1.3 → Social demand validation (strong/moderate/weak signal)
Phase 2   → Content gap analysis + comment mining + competitor audit
Phase 5   → Audience language mining → natural copy that resonates
Phase 5n  → Social proof embedding with real engagement metrics
Phase 6   → Post-write keyword freshness check
```

Social proof gets embedded inline with attribution:
- `"A discussion in r/{subreddit} with {upvotes} upvotes highlighted..."`
- `"In a video with {views} views, {channel} demonstrated..."`
- Each earns a `[SOCIAL DATA]` information gain marker

ByCrawl is optional — every skill gracefully falls back to `WebSearch`-only research if no API key is configured.

### 12 Content Templates
Auto-selected based on topic and intent: how-to guide, listicle, case study, comparison, pillar page, product review, thought leadership, roundup, tutorial, news analysis, data research, FAQ knowledge base.

### 5-Category Quality Scoring (100 Points)

Scoring bands: Exceptional (90-100), Strong (80-89), Acceptable (70-79), Below Standard (60-69), Rewrite (<60).

### AI Content Detection
